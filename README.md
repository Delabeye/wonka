# Verification and Validation with an ONtology and Knowledge-based Approach (WONKA)

This is an Owleardy2 implementation of the WONKA methodology, as described in our paper:

Delabeye, R., Penas, O., & Plateaux, R. (2022, October). [Scalable ontology-based V&V process for heterogeneous systems and applications](https://hal.science/hal-03912273/document). In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings (pp. 341-350).

A more detailed description of the case study is presented in the [S.mart benchmark repository](https://github.com/GIS-S-mart), where a dedicated benchmark on [Early Verification and Validation](https://github.com/GIS-S-mart/Benchmark-1_MBSE_for_Early_Validation_and_Verification) is presented.
